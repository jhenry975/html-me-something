		<p> I earned my AS degree in Information Systems at Saint Louis Community College.  At this time, my focus was computer networking.  I took many courses in Cisco etc.  While completing my degree, one of my required courses was Introduction to Java.  I was very interested in this Java class.  However, that would be my only required programming course for the degree requirements.  My degree was almost complete at this time so I decided to stay on course with the computer networking.  I was, and still am, interested in computer networks as well as programming.</p>

			<p>My next step in my journey was at <strong>Webster University</strong>.</p>

		<p> When I completed my AS degree, I wanted to continue my education.  I decided to find a program that would match up best with the courses I took for my AS degree.  I was not able to find a BS program for networking, but decided to enter a BS in Information Management program at Webster University.</p>
		<p> One of the first required courses for the program was C++.  I enjoyed learning about object oriented programming in this course.  I was required to take two semesters of C++.  Because I enjoyed programming, I decided to minor in computer applications (web programming).  These were my favorite courses.</p>
